<h2>Frequently Unknown SKUs</h2>
<b>Books</b>
If a book is obviously used, it is r2 or b2. If it looks new, it may be new. Try the barcode. If it does not work, then it is b2.<br>
r2 - Rickland Used Books (usually have a sticker on the back)<br>
b2 - Used Books (any used books without stickers on the back)

<h2>Magic Singles</h2>
If you are selling magic singles, put the <b>total</b> value of the singles in the box where it says "Total price of all Magic Singles."

If the card has a price on the sleeve, it's easy. Just take the price from the sleeve.<br>
Commons are $0.25.<br>
Uncommons are $0.75.<br>
All other cards, we use <a href="http://www.starcitygames.com">Starcitygames.com</a>. Just search the name of the card and use that price.<p>
Note that once you have updated the order, when the "singles" item appears there is a quantity box next to it. If you change this value, it will multiply the price by that much. Generally, you should leave it as 1 unless you know what you are doing.
<p>
<b>Buying Singles</b>
Tam, Kiernan, Michael, and Dan are the only four people who can buy singles. If someone is looking to sell singles, they will have to talk to one of those four people, preferably Tam in order to sell their wares.
<p>
We may be willing to offer cash if the cards are salable enough, but they will get a better deal if they are willing to take store credit.
